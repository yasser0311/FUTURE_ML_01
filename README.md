- Forecasting with **Facebook Prophet**
- Visualizations: Line plots, seasonality, confidence intervals

### 📊 2. Power BI Dashboard
**File:** `SalesForecastDashboard.pbix`

Includes:
- Actual vs Forecast Line Chart
- Confidence Interval Ribbon Area Chart
- KPI Cards (Next Month Forecast, Forecast Growth %)
- Trend & Seasonality views
- Slicers by Year and Month
- Executive summary and business recommendations

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- Time Series Forecasting using **Prophet**
- Feature Engineering with pandas
- Business Insight Extraction
- Power BI Dashboard Design
- DAX for KPI metrics like:
  - `Forecast Growth %`
  - `Forecast_Next_Month`

## 💡 Key Insights from Forecast

- 📈 Sales expected to peak in **November–December** (holiday season)
- 🕒 **Q2** shows signs of a potential slowdown — recommend seasonal campaigns
- 📊 Trend and yearly seasonality clearly reflect business cycles
- ⚠️ Confidence intervals widen post-forecast horizon — plan conservatively
